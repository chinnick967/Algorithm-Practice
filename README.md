This is a repository with examples of many of the Algorithmic problems I have completed over at CodeWars in my spare time.

I work on these problems to brush up on my problem-solving skills, learn creative solutions, and for fun.

You can see all my completed problems at https://www.codewars.com/users/chinnick967/completed, but the website hides my solutions to prevent cheating.
